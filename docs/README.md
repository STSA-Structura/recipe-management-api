# API Development

Got it! Let's focus on enhancing your application itself beyond testing. Here are some next steps for improving functionality, structure, and maintainability:

### 1. **Implement Data Persistence (Database Integration)**

- **Set Up a Database**: Integrate a database like SQLite, SQL Server, or PostgreSQL for storing recipes persistently.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Use EF Core to map your `Recipe` model to database tables, enabling CRUD operations that persist beyond application restarts.
- **Migrations**: Set up EF Core migrations to keep the database schema in sync with model changes.

### 2. **Create a Service Layer**

- **Abstract Business Logic**: Introduce a `RecipeService` (e.g., `IRecipeService` and `RecipeService` implementations) to encapsulate the recipe-related logic. This keeps your controller focused on handling HTTP requests.
- **Dependency Injection**: Register `RecipeService` in `Program.cs` and inject it into the `RecipesController`. This approach makes the code cleaner and enables easier maintenance.

### 3. **Add DTOs and AutoMapper for Data Transfer**

- **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**: Create DTOs for incoming (e.g., `RecipeCreateDto`) and outgoing data (e.g., `RecipeDto`). This pattern ensures that your API doesnâ€™t directly expose your internal models.
- **AutoMapper**: Use AutoMapper to simplify mapping between your entities and DTOs, making code cleaner and less error-prone.

### 4. **Implement Validation with FluentValidation**

- **Define Validation Rules**: Use **FluentValidation** to enforce rules (e.g., required fields, length constraints) for your models and DTOs. This can prevent bad data from reaching your business logic.
- **Integrate Validation**: Integrate these validations into your controller methods so that they automatically return validation errors for invalid inputs.

### 5. **Add Swagger for API Documentation**

- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Install and configure **Swashbuckle** to generate Swagger documentation for your API. This is especially useful for providing an interactive UI for exploring and testing API endpoints.
- **Custom Descriptions**: Add detailed summaries and parameter descriptions to your API methods for more user-friendly documentation.

### 6. **Configure Logging and Exception Handling**

- **Centralized Logging**: Set up structured logging using **Serilog** or **Microsoft.Extensions.Logging**. This makes it easier to track and troubleshoot issues.
- **Global Error Handling**: Add middleware for global exception handling to ensure all unhandled exceptions are caught and return a standardized error response.

### 7. **Consider Adding Caching**

- **In-Memory Caching**: For frequently requested data, use in-memory caching to reduce database hits and improve performance.
- **Distributed Cache**: If scaling to multiple instances, explore a distributed cache (e.g., Redis) to keep cached data consistent across instances.

### 8. **Enhance Security with Authentication and Authorization**

- **Authentication**: Implement authentication (e.g., using JWT or OAuth2) if your application requires user-specific data access.
- **Authorization**: Configure role-based or policy-based authorization to restrict certain operations (like adding, updating, or deleting recipes) to specific user roles.

### 9. **Add Pagination and Sorting for GetAllRecipes**

- **Pagination**: Modify `GetAllRecipes` to accept parameters for `page` and `pageSize`. This improves performance by reducing payload size for large datasets.
- **Sorting**: Allow sorting by different fields (e.g., recipe name or date created) to improve data access flexibility.

### 10. **Organize Solution Structure for Scale**

- **Modular Folder Structure**: Group related files by feature (e.g., `Recipes` feature with its controller, service, model, and DTOs).
- **Layered Architecture**: Consider splitting the codebase into `Controllers`, `Services`, `Repositories`, and `Models` layers for clearer separation of concerns.
