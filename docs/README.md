# API Development Roadmap

These steps focus on building a robust API application with a structured, scalable, and maintainable approach.

## 1. **Define Entities and DTOs**

- **Entities**: Begin with defining core entities like `Recipe` that represent the data structure in your application. This forms the basis for data storage and business logic.
- **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**: Create DTOs for various operations, such as `RecipeCreateDto` for incoming data during creation and `RecipeDto` for returning data to the client. Using DTOs prevents exposing internal models directly to the API consumers and allows you to control which fields are accessible.

## 2. **Implement Data Persistence (Database Integration)**

- **Set Up a Database**: Choose a relational database like SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or SQLite for storing persistent recipe data.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Use EF Core to map entities to database tables, allowing CRUD operations that persist data.
- **Migrations**: Use EF Core migrations to keep the database schema synchronized with your entities as they evolve.

## 3. **Create a Service Layer**

- **Abstract Business Logic**: Introduce a `RecipeService` (e.g., `IRecipeService` and `RecipeService` implementations) to encapsulate the business logic. This allows your controller to focus purely on handling HTTP requests and delegate processing logic to the service layer.
- **Dependency Injection**: Register `RecipeService` in `Program.cs` and inject it into `RecipesController`.

## 4. **Add AutoMapper for Simplified Data Mapping**

- **AutoMapper**: Use AutoMapper to map between your entities and DTOs, reducing boilerplate code and minimizing the risk of mapping errors.
- **Mapping Profiles**: Create a `MappingProfile` to define mappings for entities and DTOs, ensuring maintainability.

## 5. **Implement Validation with FluentValidation**

- **Define Validation Rules**: Use **FluentValidation** to add rules (e.g., required fields, length constraints) for entities and DTOs. This can prevent invalid data from reaching your applicationâ€™s core.
- **Integrate Validation**: Integrate validations directly in the controller methods so invalid inputs return meaningful error responses.

## 6. **Add Swagger for API Documentation**

- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Use **Swashbuckle** to generate Swagger documentation. This provides a UI for exploring and testing API endpoints.
- **Detailed Descriptions**: Customize API documentation with summaries and parameter descriptions for clarity.

## 7. **Configure Logging and Exception Handling**

- **Centralized Logging**: Set up structured logging with **Serilog** or **Microsoft.Extensions.Logging** for tracking issues.
- **Global Error Handling**: Add middleware for global exception handling, ensuring that unhandled exceptions are caught and return consistent error responses.

## 8. **Consider Adding Caching**

- **In-Memory Caching**: For frequently requested data, add in-memory caching to reduce database calls and improve performance.
- **Distributed Cache**: If scaling to multiple instances, consider a distributed cache (e.g., Redis) for data consistency across instances.

## 9. **Enhance Security with Authentication and Authorization**

- **Authentication**: Implement authentication (e.g., using JWT or OAuth2) to secure access.
- **Authorization**: Configure role-based or policy-based authorization to restrict certain actions based on user roles.

## 10. **Add Pagination and Sorting for GetAllRecipes**

- **Pagination**: Update `GetAllRecipes` to accept `page` and `pageSize` parameters, reducing the data load for large sets.
- **Sorting**: Add sorting functionality (e.g., by name or date created) to improve data retrieval options.

## 11. **Organize Solution Structure for Scale**

- **Modular Folder Structure**: Organize folders by feature (e.g., `Recipes` for the controller, service, entity, and DTOs).
- **Layered Architecture**: Segment the codebase into `Controllers`, `Services`, `Repositories`, and `Models` layers for clear separation of concerns.

Would you like to start with code examples for entities and DTOs? Or perhaps an initial setup for database integration?
