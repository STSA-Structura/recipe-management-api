### Steps to Populate the `docs/` Folder

- **README.md**: Include a summary of the API’s purpose, usage instructions, and links to the other docs files.
- **API_Specifications**: Maintain OpenAPI or Swagger definitions here, updated as you develop new endpoints.
- **Models**: Add a `.md` file per primary model (`Recipe.md`, `Ingredient.md`) with details on fields, relationships, and any validation rules.
- **Authentication_Guide.md**: Document authentication details, such as OAuth flows, tokens, and role-based access control if needed.
- **Deployment_Guide.md**: Outline deployment configurations for different environments.
- **CI_CD_Pipeline.md**: Summarize the CI/CD pipeline, including tools used (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines) and deployment stages.

This structure is flexible and can expand over time, especially as you add more features or documentation needs. You’re all set to start documenting directly within the **`recipe-management-api`** repo!
